This project presents a sophisticated software system built with the goal of ensuring and monitoring the quality of road surfaces in cities. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Convolutionary Neural Networks and Image Recognition, this system aims to serve as an indispensable tool for contractors, drivers, and pedestrians alike.

## 🎯 Purpose

The development of this system seeks to:

- Offer contractors a convenient monitoring mechanism for road quality.
- Alert drivers and pedestrians about potential road surface problems in real-time.
- Enhance the overall road safety standards in the city.

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning & Image Processing:** Python, TensorFlow, Transfer Learning.
- **Backend:** Django (compliant with OpenAPI specification Version 3.0.3), PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS combined with Vue.js and Progressive Web Application (PWA) capabilities.
- **Hardware Integration:** Raspberry Pi 3 and Drones.

## 🛠️ System Components

1. **REST API Backend**: A robust and scalable backend system that caters to data storage, processing, and retrieval.
2. **PWA Client**: An interactive web interface ensuring seamless user experience across devices.
3. **IoT Integration**: Using drones equipped with Raspberry Pi 3 for real-time road surface scanning and image capturing.
